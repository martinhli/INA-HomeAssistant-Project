# INA-HomeAssistant-Project

## Project Description

It is desired to have a home automation system that uses the lent devices to do some
interesting stuff. Other external services/devices should also be added by the
workgroup.

The minimal requirements for the implementation are:
* The solution must operate locally using Home Assistant.
* Remote access through mobile phone or web interface is mandatory.
* Programming is mandatory, e.g. using YAML, Python, etc.
* Closed/proprietary components can be integrated at convenience, including
cloud-based remote solutions.
* MQTT usage in some way is also mandatory.

## What needs to be done

* Set up communication between the Home Assistant and the ConBee to be able to connect Zigbee devices
* Integrate Home Assistant Cloud with our Home Assistant System
* Write Javascript code that can display a "dashboard" of all the information from connected devices
* Start actually connecting devices lol
